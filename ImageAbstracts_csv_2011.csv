A method and system for the automatic identification of audio video multimedia and/or data recordings based on immutable characteristics of these works. The invention does not require the insertion of identifying codes or signals into the recording. This allows the system to be used to identify existing recordings that have not been through a coding process at the time that they were generated. Instead each work to be recognized is &#x201c;played&#x201d; into the system where it is subjected to an automatic signal analysis process that locates salient features and computes a statistical representation of these properties. These features are then stored as patterns for later recognition of live input signal streams. A different set of features is derived for each audio or video work to be identified and stored. During real-time monitoring of a signal stream a similar automatic signal analysis process is carried out and many features are computed for comparison with the patterns stored in a large feature database. For each particular pattern stored in the database only the relevant characteristics are compared with the real-time feature set.

A printer fetches a horizontal direction DCT coefficient group and a vertical direction DCT coefficient group for each block from the JPEG data. The printer selects edge patterns similar to the brightness changes expressed by these coefficient groups from a specified table and records those pattern numbers in a RAM. The printer judges whether or not the brightness changes of the blocks with each other adjacent are continuous based on the pattern number of each block recorded in the RAM.

Then based on this cumulative value the printer determines the presence or absence of image blur. It is possible thereby to detect with good precision the blur of images even for high resolution images while reducing the used memory capacity.

Systems and methods are described for face recognition using discriminatively trained orthogonal rank one tensor projections. In an exemplary system images are treated as tensors rather than as conventional vectors of pixels. During runtime the system designs visual features&#x2014;embodied as tensor projections&#x2014;that minimize intraclass differences between instances of the same face while maximizing interclass differences between the face and faces of different people.

In image processing according to the prior art the important part of photographic image data referred to herein as the object could not be determined and therefore required human participation. A computer 21 which is the core of image processing calculates an edginess which is an image variation from a differential value of data for adjacent picture elements in a step SA110 and determines object picture elements by selecting only images with a large variation in steps SA120 SA130. As optimum parameters for contrast correction and lightness compensation are calculated from image data for object picture elements in steps SA310-SA330 image processing indicators based on object picture elements are determined and optimum image processing can be performed automatically. After summing a luminance distribution for each area of the image which is a feature amount while uniformly selecting picture elements in a step SB110 a reevaluation is performed by a weighting determined for each area in a step SB120 and a luminance distribution strongly influenced by the luminance distribution of the photographed object is thus obtained with uniform sampling. After determining the intensity of this luminance distribution insteps SB130-SB150 the image data is converted in a step SB160 and image processing can therefore be performed with optimum intensity while reducing the processing amount.

Methods and devices for scanning an incoming datastream for a plurality of target patterns. The scanning system receives an incoming data stream and stores the stream as sequential symbols in a register array. Previously received symbols are shifted in the array as incoming symbols are shifted in. A trigger stage computes a hash value based on the k most recently received symbols.

If the more detailed comparison is indicated a full comparison stage retrieves the relevant target pattern and compares the target pattern with the sequentially stored symbols in the array. To improve the determination of whether the detailed comparison is required a confidence stage may be placed between the trigger stage and the full comparison stage. The confidence stage computes a hashing function value based on c sequential symbols in the array with c&#x2267;k. The hashing function value is then used to determine whether the more time consuming symbol by symbol comparison is needed.

System and method for visually tracking a target object silhouette in a plurality of video frames under very general conditions. The tracker does not make any assumption about the object or the scene. The tracker works by approximating in each frame a PDF probability distribution function of the target s bitmap and then estimating the maximum a posteriori bitmap. The PDF is marginalized over all possible motions per pixel thus avoiding the stage in which optical flow is determined. This is an advantage over other general-context trackers that do not use the motion cue at all or rely on the error-prone calculation of optical flow. Using a Gibbs distribution with a first order neighborhood system yields a bitmap PDF whose maximization may be transformed into that of a quadratic pseudo-Boolean function the maximum of which is approximated via a reduction to a maximum-flow problem.

The apparatus determines a position of an object reference point in the input image from a position of each object corresponding point and the vector of the typical corresponding point matching with the object corresponding point. When the positions of the object reference point are concentrated the apparatus judges that an object picture having the object corresponding points in the input image matches with the typical image and the apparatus recognizes the picture as an object indicated by the typical image.

A solution for resolving an occlusion in a video image which provides an environment in which portions of a video image in which occlusions have occurred may be determined and analyzed to determine the type of occlusion. Furthermore regions of the video image may be analyzed to determine which object in the occlusion the region belongs to. The determinations and analysis may use such factors as pre-determined attributes of an object such as color or texture of the object and/or a temporal association of the object among others.
Described is a technology by which a large image is processed into a seamless radiometric mean image containing meaningful image objects. A large source image is tiled into non-overlapping tiles which are each segmented into regions and merged via their regions. Source image pixels are separated into tiles comprising rows and columns. Once tiled the tiles are segmented into regions with each region having an identifier and other associated information such as size data boundary data and neighbor data. The tiles are merged by merging columns or rows of tiles into row blocks or column blocks respectively. The row blocks or column blocks are vertically or horizontally merged respectively. Merging may proceed by selecting a pair of regions based on merging cost merging that pair updating its associated data and data of neighbor regions based on the merge and repeating for other pairs until merging stop criteria are met.
The present invention uses invisible junctions which are a set of local features unique to every page of the electronic document to match the captured image to a part of an electronic document. The present invention includes: an image capture device a feature extraction and recognition system and database. When an electronic document is printed the feature extraction and recognition system captures an image of the document page. The features in the captured image are then extracted indexed and stored in the database. Given a query image usually a small patch of some document page captured by a low resolution image capture device the features in the query image are extracted and compared against those stored in the database to identify the query image. The present invention also includes methods for feature extraction feature indexing feature retrieval and geometric estimation.
