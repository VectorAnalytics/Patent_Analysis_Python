A digital-signature is obtained by digitising a set of data points obtained by scanning a coherent beam over a paper cardboard or other article and measuring the scatter. A thumbnail-digital signature is also determined by digitising an amplitude spectrum of a Fourier transform of the set of data points. A database of digital signatures and their thumbnails can thus be built up. The authenticity of an article can later be verified by re-scanning the article to determine its digital signature and thumbnail and then searching the database for a match. Searching is done on the basis of the Fourier transform thumbnail to improve search speed. Speed is improved since in a pseudo-random bit sequence any bit shift only affects the phase spectrum and not the amplitude spectrum of a Fourier transform represented in polar coordinates. The amplitude spectrum stored in the thumbnail can therefore be matched without any knowledge of the unknown bit shift caused by registry errors between the original scan and the re-scan.

A search results page contains images that are organized based on the visual features of those images; images that have common visual features are grouped together using either a folding or a reciprocal election technique. Images that pertain to a particular meaning of a query term are less likely to be scattered across the page.

Consequently space for more representative images becomes available on the image search results page. Thus search results page contains visually diverse representative images; space on the results page is not wasted by repeatedly showing the same image. The initial image search results page also therefore is more likely to contain representative images that otherwise would have occurred too far down a relevance-ranked list to be included within the initial search results page.

This invention provides a system and method for determining position of a viewed object in three dimensions by employing 2D machine vision processes on each of a plurality of planar faces of the object and thereby refining the location of the object. First a rough pose estimate of the object is derived. This rough pose estimate can be based upon predetermined pose data or can be derived by acquiring a plurality of planar face poses of the object using for example multiple cameras and correlating the corners of the trained image pattern which have known coordinates relative to the origin to the acquired patterns. Once the rough pose is achieved this is refined by defining the pose as a quaternion a b c and d for rotation and a three variables x y z for translation and employing an iterative weighted least squares error calculation to minimize the error between the edgelets of trained model image and the acquired runtime edgelets. The overall refined/optimized pose estimate incorporates data from each of the cameras acquired images. Thereby the estimate minimizes the total error between the edgelets of each camera s/view s trained model image and the associated camera s/view s acquired runtime edgelets. A final transformation of trained features relative to the runtime features is derived from the iterative error computation.

The process entails for each target pixel i determining coordinate values for the target pixel ii determining a surrounding pixel area for the target pixel iii and processing each pixel in the surrounding pixel area to determine whether or not to updated the value of the target pixel. In processing each surrounding pixel a determination is made whether the pixel has a value of 1. If not then the next surrounding pixel is processed. If so then a determination is made which pixel element of a structuring element overlays the target pixel and whether that SE pixel has a value of 1. If so then the value of the target pixel is updated. If not then the next pixel in the surrounding pixel area is processed. Once the target pixel has been updated a set number of times to a predetermined value e.g. 2 the processing of the remaining surrounding pixels is terminated. After all target pixels have been processed an output image is obtained by setting target pixels having a value of 2 to a binary value of 1 and setting the other pixels to a binary value of 0. The resultant output image is an erosion image that is then output.

Systems methods and computer readable media are disclosed for improving compression efficiency and quality in a remote session via tile image classification and variable encoding.

An optical character recognition process characterizes text lines in a textual image by their base-line mean-line and x-height. The base-line for at least one text line in the image is determined by finding a parametric curve that maximizes a first fitness function that depends on the values of pixels through which the parametric curve passes and pixels below the parametric curve. The base-line corresponds to the parametric curve for which the first fitness function is maximized. The first fitness function is designed so that it increases with increasing lightless or brightness of pixels immediately below the parametric curve while also increasing with decreasing lightness of pixels through which the parametric curve passes. The mean-line is determined by incrementally shifting the base-line upward by predetermined amounts e.g. a single pixel until a second fitness function for the shifted base-line is maximized. The second fitness function is essentially the inverse of the first fitness function. Specifically the second fitness function increases with increasing lightless of pixels immediately above the shifted base-line while also increasing with decreasing lightness of pixels through which the shifted base-line passes. The x-height is equal to the sum of the predetermined amounts by which the base-line is shifted upward in order to maximize the second fitness function. In some cases different groups of text-lines in the textual image may be characterized differently from one another. For example each group may be characterized by a most probable x-height for that group.
