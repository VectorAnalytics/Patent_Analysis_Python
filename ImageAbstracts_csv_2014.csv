Approaches to segmentation or detection of objects and their boundaries in images or other data sets do not rely on machine learning approaches that aim to minimize pixel-level agreement between a computer and a human. Optimizing such pixel-level agreement does not in general provide the best possible result if boundary detection is a means to the ultimate goal of image segmentation rather than an end in itself. In some examples end-to-end learning of image segmentation specifically targets boundary errors with topological consequences but otherwise does not require the computer to &#x201c;slavishly&#x201d; imitate human placement of boundaries. In some examples this is accomplished by modifying a standard learning procedure such that human boundary tracings are allowed to change during learning except at locations critical to preserving topology.

In one implementation the sense-orientation method and system to which the current application is directed employs a relatively small set of orientation-marker characters that occur frequently in printed text and that lack rotational symmetry. In this implementation text-character images within a region of a scanned-document image are compared to each of a set of orientation-marker patterns corresponding to orientation-marker characters in order to identify images corresponding to orientation-marker patterns in the text-containing region of the scanned-document image and to determine an overall sense orientation for the text-containing region of the scanned-document image based on the orientations of the identified orientation-marker patterns.
A difference in intensities of a pair of pixels in an image is repeatedly compared to a threshold with the pair of pixels being separated by at least one pixel &#x201c;skipped pixel&#x201d; . When the threshold is found to be exceeded a selected position of a selected pixel in the pair and at least one additional position adjacent to the selected position are added to a set of positions. The comparing and adding are performed multiple times to generate multiple such sets each set identifying a region in the image e.g. an MSER. Sets of positions identifying regions whose attributes satisfy a test are merged to obtain a merged set. Intensities of pixels identified in the merged set are used to generate binary values for the region followed by classification of the region as text/non-text. Regions classified as text are supplied to an optical character recognition OCR system.

In some embodiments when processing source images the source images may be downsampled during a portion of the processing to reduce computational overhead. Additionally some highly parallel computations may be performed by a GPU to further enhance performance.
There is described a method and a device for forming a panoramic image wherein it is decided to add a current image in a current panoramic image based on definitions of edges of the current image and the current panoramic image.
Systems methods and computer readable media to register images in real-time and that are capable of producing reliable registrations even when the number of high frequency image features is small. The disclosed techniques may also provide a quantitative measure of a registration s quality. The latter may be used to inform the user and/or to automatically determine when visual registration techniques may be less accurate than motion sensor-based approaches. When such a case is detected an image capture device may be automatically switched from visual-based to sensor-based registration. Disclosed techniques quickly determine indicators of an image s overall composition row and column projections which may be used to determine the translation of a first image relative to a second image. The translation so determined may be used to align/register the two images.
An automated process uses a local positioning system to acquire location i.e. position and orientation data for one or more movable target objects. In cases where the target objects have the capability to move under computer control this automated process can use the measured location data to control the position and orientation of such target objects. The system leverages the measurement and image capture capability of the local positioning system and integrates controllable marker lights image processing and coordinate transformation computation to provide tracking information for vehicle location control. The resulting system enables position and orientation tracking of objects in a reference coordinate system.
Various technologies described herein pertain to computing surface normals for points in a point cloud. The point cloud is representative of a measured surface of a physical object. A point in the point cloud can be set as a point of origin and points in the point cloud can be modeled as electrostatic point charges. Moreover a point of least electrostatic potential on a sphere centered at the point of origin can be computed as a function of the electrostatic point charges. Further unit vector with a direction from the point of origin to the point of least electrostatic potential on the sphere can be assigned as a normal for the point of origin.
Methods systems and apparatus including computer programs encoded on computer storage media for generating image search results. One of the methods includes receiving first image search results responsive to a text query each first image search result associated with a respective first score indicating a relevance of an image represented by the first image search result to the text query. Second image search results responsive to a query image are received each second image search result associated with a respective second score indicating a measure of similarity between an image represented by the second image search result and the query image. A set of final image search results is selected including combining first scores and second scores of the selected first image search results. The final image search results are ordered by similarity to the query image.
Various embodiments enable a device to perform tasks such as processing an image to recognize and locate text in the image and providing the recognized text an application executing on the device for performing a function e.g. calling a number opening an internet browser etc. associated with the recognized text. In at least one embodiment processing the image includes substantially simultaneously or concurrently processing the image with at least two recognition engines such as at least two optical character recognition OCR engines running in a multithreaded mode. In at least one embodiment the recognition engines can be tuned so that their respective processing speeds are roughly the same. Utilizing multiple recognition engines enables processing latency to be close to that of using only one recognition engine.
