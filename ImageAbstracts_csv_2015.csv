Accurate localization of isolated particles is important in single particle based super-resolution microscopy. It allows the imaging of biological samples with nanometer-scale resolution using a simple fluorescence microscopy setup. Nevertheless conventional techniques for localizing single particles can take minutes to hours of computation time because they require up to a million localizations to form an image. In contrast the present particle localization techniques use wavelet-based image decomposition and image segmentation to achieve nanometer-scale resolution in two dimensions within seconds to minutes. This two-dimensional localization can be augmented with localization in a third dimension based on a fit to the imaging system s point-spread function PSF which may be asymmetric along the optical axis.

A system for validating motion estimation comprising a field unit 110 for obtaining a deformation vector field DVF estimating the motion by transforming a first image at a first phase of the motion into a second image at a second phase of the motion a metric unit 120 for computing a metric of a local volume change at a plurality of locations and a conformity unit 130 for computing a conformity measure based on the computed metric of the local volume change at the plurality of locations and a local property of the first or second image defined at the plurality of locations. Based on the value of the conformity measure the DFV estimating the motion is validated. Experiments show that the conformity measure based on the computed metric of a local volume change at a plurality of locations and the local property of the first or second image defined at the plurality of locations does not necessarily favor a large weight for the outer force to provide a more accurate registration. One reason for this observation may be that large deformations providing more accurate alignment often lead to deformations resulting in unreasonably large volume changes. DVFs comprising such deformations thus are more likely to be discarded by the system of the invention.

Selecting these wavebands called &#x201c;sparse bands &#x201d; is an iterative process. One or more search techniques of varying computational complexity are used in the process. The techniques rely on various selection criteria including a signal to clutter ratio that measures the &#x201c;goodness&#x201d; of band selection. A convenient example of the filtering engine uses several of the techniques together in a layered approach. In this novel approach simpler computational techniques are applied initially to reduce a number of bands. More computationally intensive techniques then search the reduced band space. Accordingly the filtering engine efficiently selects a set of sparse bands tailored for each target and each scene and maintains some of the detection capability provided with a full set of wavebands.

Embodiments of the invention provide a system and method that is able to automatically provide a starting point for 2D to 3D image registration without relying on human recognition of features shown in the 2D image. This is achieved by pre-processing the 3D data to obtain synthetically generated 2D images of those parts of the 3D data volume which will be used for registration purposes. Many different synthetically generated 2D images of the or each part of the 3D volume are produced each from a different possible viewing direction. Each of these synthetic images is then subject to a feature extraction process to extract characterizing feature data of the registration feature shown in the images. Once the feature extraction has been undertaken for each image when registration is to be performed the real-time 2D image is processed by applying each of the sets of extracted features thereto to try and identify which set best matches the registration features in the 2D image. For example where a generalized Hough transform was used in the feature extraction the R tables would be applied to the 2D image to obtain respective accumulation images. The accumulation images may then be ranked to identify which registration feature is shown in the 2-D image and from which view direction. This gives the required information of which registration feature is being shown in the 2D image and also the in-plane location and orientation. This information can then be used as a starting point for the 2D to 3D registration procedure.

Embodiments of the invention provide a system and method that is able to automatically provide a starting point for 2D to 3D image registration without relying on human recognition of features shown in the 2D image. This is achieved by pre-processing the 3D data to obtain synthetically generated 2D images of those parts of the 3D data volume which will be used for registration purposes. Many different synthetically generated 2D images of the or each part of the 3D volume are produced each from a different possible viewing direction. Each of these synthetic images is then subject to a feature extraction process to extract characterizing feature data of the registration feature shown in the images. Once the feature extraction has been undertaken for each image when registration is to be performed the real-time 2D image is processed by applying each of the sets of extracted features thereto to try and identify which set best matches the registration features in the 2D image. For example where a generalized Hough transform was used in the feature extraction the R tables would be applied to the 2D image to obtain respective accumulation images. The accumulation images may then be ranked to identify which registration feature is shown in the 2-D image and from which view direction. This gives the required information of which registration feature is being shown in the 2D image and also the in-plane location and orientation. This information can then be used as a starting point for the 2D to 3D registration procedure.

In accordance with one aspect the framework receives a target image a reference image statistical shape models local appearance models and a learned landmark detector. The framework may automatically detect first centerline landmarks along centerlines of articulated structures in the target image using the learned landmark detector. The framework may then determine a non-rigid transformation function that registers second centerline landmarks along centerlines of articulated structures in the reference image with the first centerline landmarks. Mean shapes of the statistical shape models may then be deformed to the target image space by applying the non-rigid transformation function on the mean shapes. The framework may further search for candidate points in the mean shapes using the local appearance models. The mean shapes may be fitted to the candidate points to generate a segmentation mask.

In an image of a sequence of images acquired by the acquisition unit an object is in each case detected which represents at least a part of a foot a shoe and/or a leg. The position of the object is determined in the respective image and a pedestrian s step is recognized as a function of a position change of the object between at least two images of the sequence of images.
A method for moving object detection based on a Fisher s Linear Discriminant-based Radial Basis Function Network FLD-based RBF network includes the following steps. A sequence of incoming frames of a fixed location delivered over a network are received. A plurality of discriminant patterns are generated from the sequence of incoming frames based on a Fisher s Linear Discriminant FLD model. A background model is constructed from the sequence of incoming frames based on a Radial Basis Function RBF network model. A current incoming frame is received and divided into a plurality of current incoming blocks. Each of the current incoming blocks is classified as either a background block or a moving object block according to the discriminant patterns. Whether a current incoming pixel of the moving object blocks among the current incoming blocks is a moving object pixel or a background pixel is determined according to the background model.
