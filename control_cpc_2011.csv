A backup system is provided that has a local electric motor and pump for some or all of hydraulic actuators. A local backup hydraulic actuator has two power sources hydraulic as primary and electrical as backup. During normal operation the hydraulic actuator receives pressurized fluid from a hydraulic system and the fluid flow to the chambers is controlled by a servo valve. If the hydraulic system fails the electronic controller detects the failure by observing the signal indicative of the pressure from the pressure sensor and the controller powers the local hydraulic pump to provide high pressure hydraulic fluid to the hydraulic actuator via the servo valve.

Since only minimal displacement inputs to such a FBW flight control system is required the travel of the pedals are exceeding compact such that pilot workload is significantly reduced through the reduction in the frequency and magnitude of aircraft control inputs.

Rudder assist mechanisms and methods are capable of being operably connected to an aircraft s rudder control system. The rudder assist mechanisms most preferably have over-the-center spring biasing functions so as to cause either substantially no spring force i.e. when the linkage is over the spring-bias center or substantially all spring force i.e. when the linkage is left or right of the spring-bias center to be exerted on the rudder control system. The rudder assist mechanism may include a control spring assembly and a linkage assembly which operably connects the control spring assembly to the rudder control assembly. The linkage assembly is moveable operably between a null position wherein substantially no spring force of the control spring assembly is transferred to the rudder control system by the linkage assembly and right and left spring-biased positions wherein right and left spring forces of the control spring assembly are transferred to the rudder control system respectively. The null position may therefore establish a dead zone of rudder deflection within a selected range of right and left rudder control surface deflection angles. Thus right and left spring forces may be transferred to the rudder control system when the rudder control surface is deflected at an angle which exceeds the selected range of deflection angles. Some embodiments include an actuator unit which is operably capable of moving the spring assembly and the linkage assembly connected thereto between a thrust symmetrical mode TSM condition and a thrust asymmetrical mode TAM condition so as to cause different spring forces to be exerted on the rudder control system in such different thrust conditions.

The control system then operates at least some of the flight control devices in response to an output of the windshear detection system.
A variable rate limit is implemented in an active inceptor haptic feedback control system.

A computer implemented method apparatus and computer usable program product for symmetric and anti-symmetric control of aircraft flight control surfaces to reduce wing-body loads. Commands are sent to symmetrically deploy outboard control surfaces to shift wing air-loads inboard based on airplane state and speed brake deployment. Surface rate retraction on a wing with peak loads is limited to reduce maximum loads due to wheel checkback accompanied by utilization of opposite wing control surfaces to retain roll characteristics. Airloads are shifted inboard on a swept wing to move the center of pressure forward thereby reducing the tail load required to perform a positive gravity maneuver. In a negative gravity maneuver speed brakes are retracted thereby reducing the positive tail load and reducing the aft body design loads. High gain feedback commands are filtered from wing structural modes above one hertz by a set of linear and non-linear filters.

An extension of a latch force from the flight path hold detent to the altitude hold detent is present during changes in vehicle direction.

The lower load sensing assembly provides upper indications of the applied forces in the lower load path when the lower load path is disconnected. A computer system receives the upper and lower indications of applied forces and analyzes the upper and lower indications thereby monitoring the structural integrity and safety of the upper and lower load paths by annunciating the detection of a failed portion thereof.
An aircraft flight surface control system and method simultaneously provides the benefits of both an active/active system architecture and in active/standby system architecture. The system is preferably implemented using hydraulic actuator assemblies and electromechanical actuator assemblies coupled to the same flight control surface. During normal system operations the electromechanical actuator assemblies are energized to supply a relatively minimal force to associated flight control surfaces. In effect the electromechanical actuators although energized may be pulled along by the associated hydraulic actuator assemblies until needed. Thus the electromechanical actuator assemblies are controlled in a manner that closely resembles the active/standby architecture.
A servo-controlled system is disclosed for providing simulated feel equivalent to that of traditional mechanical hand controllers. Processed position and force sensor signals are used in a feedback loop that controls the motor mechanically connected to the stick.
