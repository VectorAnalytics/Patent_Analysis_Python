The actuator locking mechanism is a bi-directional secondary load path lock that operates under both compression and tension loads via a radial locking wedge and axial slide lock system. This locking mechanism is designed to effectively protect against structural disconnect after a primary load path failure occurs and to minimize the axial play in the engaged secondary load path.
