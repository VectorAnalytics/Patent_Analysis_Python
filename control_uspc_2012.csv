A system allowing for the active management of aerostatic lift in buoyant and semi-buoyant aerial vehicles comprised of a high tensile-strength outer pressure cell of a given volume and an inner compression cell of only slightly smaller dimensions. The inner compression cell is filled with a lifting gas such as helium or hydrogen to some fractional volume of its maximum allowing for expansion of the lifting gas at different operational altitudes.
