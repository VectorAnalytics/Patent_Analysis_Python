The actuator locking mechanism is a bi-directional secondary load path lock that operates under both compression and tension loads via a radial locking wedge and axial slide lock system. This locking mechanism is designed to effectively protect against structural disconnect after a primary load path failure occurs and to minimize the axial play in the engaged secondary load path.

This axial displacement is eliminated by the slide locking system minimizing the axial play. The makeup of this radial locking design also features a cageless roller implementation which captures the rollers within the features of the V-shaped ramp design.

In order to save time during the development of vehicles in particular aircraft in particular to save wind tunnel time it is suggested to configure the vortex generator 10 switchable. Further the invention relates to various uses of such a switchable vortex generator 10 in particular on models in fluid-dynamic channels and in fluid-dynamic channel tests.
A system for controlling yaw associated with an airship may include one or more vertical control surfaces associated with the airship a first power source and a second power source each configured to provide a thrust associated with the airship and a yaw control configured to receive an input indicative of a desired yaw angle. The system may further include a controller communicatively connected to the yaw control the one or more vertical control surfaces and the first and second power sources. The controller may be configured to receive an output signal from the yaw control corresponding to the desired yaw angle and to generate a control signal configured to modify a state associated with at least one of the one or more vertical control surfaces the first power source and the second power source such that the airship substantially attains the desired yaw angle.
