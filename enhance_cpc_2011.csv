The present invention provides a method and apparatus to enhance the image contrast of a digital image device while simultaneously compensating for image intensity inhomogeneity regardless of the source. The present invention corrects intensity inhomogeneities producing a more uniform image appearance. Also the image is enhanced through increased contrast e.g. tissue contrast in a medical image. The method makes no assumptions as to the source of the inhomogeneities e.g. physical device characteristics or positioning of the object being imaged. In the method the error between the histogram of the spatially-weighted original image and a specified histogram is minimized. The specified histogram may be selected to increase contrast generally or particularly for accentuation e.g. on localized regions of interest. The weighting is preferably achieved by two-dimensional interpolation of a sparse grid of control points overlaying the image. A sparse grid is used rather than a dense one to compensate for slowly-varying image non-uniformity. Also sparseness reduces the computational complexity as the final weight set involves the solution of simultaneous linear equations whose number is the size of the chosen grid.

The process entails for each target pixel i determining coordinate values for the target pixel ii determining a surrounding pixel area for the target pixel iii and processing each pixel in the surrounding pixel area to determine whether or not to updated the value of the target pixel. In processing each surrounding pixel a determination is made whether the pixel has a value of 1. If not then the next surrounding pixel is processed. If so then a determination is made which pixel element of the structuring element overlays the target pixel and whether that pixel has a value of 1. If so then the value of the target pixel is updated. If not then the next pixel in the surrounding pixel area is processed. Once the target pixel has been updated one time the processing of the remaining surrounding pixels is terminates. If processing of all surrounding pixels results in no update to the target pixel then the target pixel is not updated. After all target pixels have been processed the resultant image is output as the dilation image.
