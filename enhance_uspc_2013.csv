A content-aware image retargeting technique uses an &#x201c;importance filtering&#x201d; technique to preserve important information in the resizing of an image. The image saliency is first filtered guided by the image itself to achieve a structure-consistent importance map.

In the present case a variable is derived using an empty image which variable reproduces the amount of noise and this variable then determines the type and extent of a filtering process. Hence the image processing is adapted to the respective individual noise behavior of the respective X-ray beam detector. This is particularly suitable if the X-ray beam detector is a flat-panel detector 100 with a scintillator 22 and photodetector elements 12 .
There is provided an apparatus for improving the sharpness of an image which may prevent occurrence of distortion of an image in an edge enhancement process of the image by applying an active weight in accordance with a two-dimensional 2D high pass filtering value of the image. The apparatus may include: a 2D high pass filter outputting a high frequency element value for the luminance values of pixels of an input image; a weight generating unit generating a weight changed depending on a magnitude of the high frequency element value; a weight applying unit applying the weight to the high frequency element value; and an edge enhancement image generating unit adding to the luminance values of the pixels of the input image the high frequency element value to which the weight is applied to thereby output an image of which an edge is enhanced.
An exposure condition when obtaining a sensed image is input. Shake information when obtaining the sensed image is input. A filter to be used to correct a blur of the sensed image is generated based on the exposure condition and a weight value including a non-integer obtained from the shake information.

A method of reducing blurring in an image of size greater than M columns by N rows of pixels comprises deriving a blur kernel k representing the blur in the image and deriving an inverse blur kernel k&#x2212;1. The inverse blur kernel is given by I where h m is the sum of the first m terms of the series II &#x3b4; is the Dirac delta m is greater than 1 and h m is a two dimensional matrix of size M&#xd7;N. The two dimensional matrix h m is convolved with the image over the whole image in the image pixel domain to produce an image with reduced blur. The method may be applied to a video sequence allowing the sequence of images to be deblurred in real time.
A method for mitigating image distortions induced by optical wave propagation through a random media e.g. atmospheric turbulence or volume of water from a stream of video data provided by a single shortexposure image sensor is described. The method is based on the two following sequential steps: 1 enhancement of the raw video stream and 2 fusion of the enhanced stream using the lucky region fusion LRF technique. The first step enhances features of the raw image stream the LRF method success is based on and especially mitigates the effect of low light level aerosol pollution dust haze and other deteriorating factors. The second step fusion of the enhanced stream is realized by sequentially merging image regions with highest quality within a temporal buffer into a single image before sliding the temporal window forward. The process is continuously repeated in order to generate a stream of fused images. The resulting fused stream hence has an image quality superior to that of any image within the buffer and demonstrates improved contrast as well as increased detail visualization. In addition the disclosed invention offers a method for automated extraction of random media atmospheric turbulence for example characteristics needed for optimizing the LRF method performance. Based solely on analysis of the enhanced video stream this has the advantage to eliminate the need for turbulence strength characterization devices e.g. scintillometer and it allows the invention to provide an optimal fused stream even when operating within an evolving environment.
Method and apparatuses for compensating for perceived blur due to inter-frame motion in a sequence of digital video frames are disclosed. One example method includes blurring a current frame using first and second blurring filters to generate first and second blurred frames respectively. A first weighted combination of the current frame the first blurred frame and the second blurred frame is then blurred with the first blurring filter to generate a third blurred frame. The current frame is combined with the third blurred frame in a second weighted combination to generate a blur-compensated frame.
Processing of a pixel of a digital image includes mapping intensity of the pixel as a smooth non-linear continuous function of the intensity and minimum and maximum intensities of a local pixel neighborhood of the pixel.
A motion blur control device uses inter-frame movement computation means to compute an inter-frame movement direction and an inter-frame movement amount from plural frame images acquired at a specific time interval. Motion blur correction means then generates a corrected frame image by correcting motion blur in a specific frame image in plural frame images based on the blur amount set within a range not exceeding the inter-frame movement amount and based on the inter-frame movement direction. Evaluation means evaluates the corrected frame image using a motion blur evaluation function. The motion blur control device controls the blur amount such that the motion blur evaluation function satisfies a specific condition.

A video encoder may use an adaptive Wiener filter inside the core video encoding loop to improve coding efficiency. In one embodiment the Wiener filter may be on the input to a motion estimation unit and in another embodiment it may be on the output of a motion compensation unit. The taps for the Wiener filter may be determined based on characteristics of at least a region of pixel intensities within a picture. Thus the filtering may be adaptive in that it varies based on the type of video being processed.
