A method and system for the automatic identification of audio video multimedia and/or data recordings based on immutable characteristics of these works. The invention does not require the insertion of identifying codes or signals into the recording. This allows the system to be used to identify existing recordings that have not been through a coding process at the time that they were generated. Instead each work to be recognized is &#x201c;played&#x201d; into the system where it is subjected to an automatic signal analysis process that locates salient features and computes a statistical representation of these properties. These features are then stored as patterns for later recognition of live input signal streams. A different set of features is derived for each audio or video work to be identified and stored. During real-time monitoring of a signal stream a similar automatic signal analysis process is carried out and many features are computed for comparison with the patterns stored in a large feature database. For each particular pattern stored in the database only the relevant characteristics are compared with the real-time feature set. Preferably during analysis and generation of reference patterns data are extracted from all time intervals of a recording. This allows a work to be recognized from a single sample taken from any part of the recording.

During a training phase we learn parts of images which assist in the object detection and recognition task. A part is a densely represented area of an image of an object to which we assign a unique label. Parts contiguously cover an image of an object to give a part label map for that object. The parts do not necessarily correspond to semantic object parts.

The redistribution is made in proportion to the similarity between the source and each destination pixel e.g. similarity of color and/or luminance values.
Pre-processing techniques for processing an image to improve the distinctiveness of an information pattern captured in the image before the information pattern is analyzed in a decoding process. The brightness of an image first is normalized by dividing the image into blocks of areas such as pixels. A brightness distribution value then is determined for each area of the image by fitting the brightness of its surrounding blocks using bilinear interpolation and extrapolation and a normalized brightness value for each area can then be obtained by dividing the original brightness value by the brightness distribution value. Next masks are created to distinguish the information pattern from content captured in the image. The masks may be generated based upon contrast differences between the brightness of pixels representing the information pattern the brightness of pixels representing content and the brightness of pixels representing the background of the writing medium.
A printer fetches a horizontal direction DCT coefficient group and a vertical direction DCT coefficient group for each block from the JPEG data. The printer selects edge patterns similar to the brightness changes expressed by these coefficient groups from a specified table and records those pattern numbers in a RAM. The printer judges whether or not the brightness changes of the blocks with each other adjacent are continuous based on the pattern number of each block recorded in the RAM. And by connecting the edge patterns when those brightness changes are continuous the printer accumulates the blur widths that exist extending over the blocks. Then based on this cumulative value the printer determines the presence or absence of image blur. It is possible thereby to detect with good precision the blur of images even for high resolution images while reducing the used memory capacity.

In an intelligent video surveillance system video processing software performs a number of operations on video data received from a camera including foreground extraction shadow removal and object tracking. The foreground extraction stage classifies each pixel of a received frame as representing either foreground or background. Since shadow regions can be wrongly classified as foreground a two-branch shadow removal operation is employed comprising weak shadow removal 32 and strong shadow removal 33 .

Methods and devices for scanning an incoming datastream for a plurality of target patterns. The scanning system receives an incoming data stream and stores the stream as sequential symbols in a register array. Previously received symbols are shifted in the array as incoming symbols are shifted in. A trigger stage computes a hash value based on the k most recently received symbols.

This is done by comparing the hash value with the indices of the target patterns in the external storage. If the more detailed comparison is indicated a full comparison stage retrieves the relevant target pattern and compares the target pattern with the sequentially stored symbols in the array. To improve the determination of whether the detailed comparison is required a confidence stage may be placed between the trigger stage and the full comparison stage. The confidence stage computes a hashing function value based on c sequential symbols in the array with c&#x2267;k. The hashing function value is then used to determine whether the more time consuming symbol by symbol comparison is needed.

The present invention uses invisible junctions which are a set of local features unique to every page of the electronic document to match the captured image to a part of an electronic document. The present invention includes: an image capture device a feature extraction and recognition system and database. When an electronic document is printed the feature extraction and recognition system captures an image of the document page. The features in the captured image are then extracted indexed and stored in the database. Given a query image usually a small patch of some document page captured by a low resolution image capture device the features in the query image are extracted and compared against those stored in the database to identify the query image. The present invention also includes methods for feature extraction feature indexing feature retrieval and geometric estimation.

This patent discloses a system to compile a landmark image search result. The system may determine a rank of each image within a visual cluster according to at least one of a low-level self-similarity score a low-level discriminative modeling score and a point wise linking score. The landmark image search result may be compiled as a function of the rank of each image.
A method of improving the lighting conditions of a real scene or video sequence. Digitally generated light is added to a scene for video conferencing over telecommunication networks. A virtual illumination equation takes into account light attenuation lambertian and specular reflection. An image of an object is captured a virtual light source illuminates the object within the image. In addition the object can be the head of the user. The position of the head of the user is dynamically tracked so that an three-dimensional model is generated which is representative of the head of the user. Synthetic light is applied to a position on the model to form an illuminated model.
An apparatus a method and a computer-readable medium having instructions encoded thereon that when executed cause a method to be carried out. The method includes dividing at least a portion of a picture of a video stream into parts of blocks and processing the parts in parallel by a plurality of interconnected processors. The processing of a respective part by its respective processor includes determining block-level temporal difference features. Each processor also performs coding functions on its respective part of the picture. The method also includes block-level processing using the block-level temporal difference features to determine which blocks in the picture are likely to be that of a face the block-level processing being at the granularity of at least a block. In one version the processing in each processor includes edge detection and color segmentation to determine block-level edge features including block-level color-segmented edge features that are then used in the block level processing.
