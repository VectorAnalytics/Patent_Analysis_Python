A digital-signature is obtained by digitising a set of data points obtained by scanning a coherent beam over a paper cardboard or other article and measuring the scatter. A thumbnail-digital signature is also determined by digitising an amplitude spectrum of a Fourier transform of the set of data points. A database of digital signatures and their thumbnails can thus be built up. The authenticity of an article can later be verified by re-scanning the article to determine its digital signature and thumbnail and then searching the database for a match. Searching is done on the basis of the Fourier transform thumbnail to improve search speed. Speed is improved since in a pseudo-random bit sequence any bit shift only affects the phase spectrum and not the amplitude spectrum of a Fourier transform represented in polar coordinates. The amplitude spectrum stored in the thumbnail can therefore be matched without any knowledge of the unknown bit shift caused by registry errors between the original scan and the re-scan.

In general this disclosure describes techniques of reducing the possibility of an image evaluation device incorrectly identifying defects in images of documents. Some defects may be apparent in the images of both sides of a document. For instance a tear in a document could be apparent in an image of a front side and an image of a rear side of the document. However the image evaluation device could erroneously identify such a tear in an image of one side of the document.

Disclosed is an improved technique for training a support vector machine using a distributed architecture. A training data set is divided into subsets and the subsets are optimized in a first level of optimizations with each optimization generating a support vector set.

This feedback may continue in multiple iterations until the same final support vector set is generated during two sequential iterations through the cascade thereby guaranteeing that the solution has converged to the global optimal solution. In various embodiments various combinations of inputs may be used by the various optimizations. The individual optimizations may be processed in parallel.

The process entails for each target pixel i determining coordinate values for the target pixel ii determining a surrounding pixel area for the target pixel iii and processing each pixel in the surrounding pixel area to determine whether or not to updated the value of the target pixel. In processing each surrounding pixel a determination is made whether the pixel has a value of 1. If not then the next surrounding pixel is processed. If so then a determination is made which pixel element of a structuring element overlays the target pixel and whether that SE pixel has a value of 1. If so then the value of the target pixel is updated. If not then the next pixel in the surrounding pixel area is processed. Once the target pixel has been updated a set number of times to a predetermined value e.g. 2 the processing of the remaining surrounding pixels is terminated. After all target pixels have been processed an output image is obtained by setting target pixels having a value of 2 to a binary value of 1 and setting the other pixels to a binary value of 0. The resultant output image is an erosion image that is then output.

There is provided a discriminative framework for image alignment. Image alignment is generally the process of moving and deforming a template to minimize the distance between the template and an image. There are essentially three elements to image alignment namely template representation distance metric and optimization method. For template representation given a face dataset with ground truth landmarks a boosting-based classifier is trained that is able to learn the decision boundary between two classes&#x2014;the warped images from ground truth landmarks e.g. positive class and those from perturbed landmarks e.g. negative class . A set of trained weak classifiers based on Haar-like rectangular features determines a boosted appearance model. A distance metric is a score from the strong classifier and image alignment is the process of optimizing e.g. maximizing the classification score. On the generic face alignment problem the proposed framework greatly improves the robustness accuracy and efficiency of alignment.

An optical character recognition process characterizes text lines in a textual image by their base-line mean-line and x-height. The base-line for at least one text line in the image is determined by finding a parametric curve that maximizes a first fitness function that depends on the values of pixels through which the parametric curve passes and pixels below the parametric curve. The base-line corresponds to the parametric curve for which the first fitness function is maximized. The first fitness function is designed so that it increases with increasing lightless or brightness of pixels immediately below the parametric curve while also increasing with decreasing lightness of pixels through which the parametric curve passes. The mean-line is determined by incrementally shifting the base-line upward by predetermined amounts e.g. a single pixel until a second fitness function for the shifted base-line is maximized. The second fitness function is essentially the inverse of the first fitness function. Specifically the second fitness function increases with increasing lightless of pixels immediately above the shifted base-line while also increasing with decreasing lightness of pixels through which the shifted base-line passes. The x-height is equal to the sum of the predetermined amounts by which the base-line is shifted upward in order to maximize the second fitness function. In some cases different groups of text-lines in the textual image may be characterized differently from one another. For example each group may be characterized by a most probable x-height for that group.

A method and system generates and compares fingerprints for videos in a video library. The video fingerprints provide a compact representation of the spatial and sequential characteristics of the video that can be used to quickly and efficiently identify video content. Because the fingerprints are based on spatial and sequential characteristics rather than exact bit sequences visual content of videos can be effectively compared even when there are small differences between the videos in compression factors source resolutions start and stop times frame rates and so on. Comparison of video fingerprints can be used for example to search for and remove copyright protected videos from a video library. Further duplicate videos can be detected and discarded in order to preserve storage space.

Faces may be indexed and identified using visual and social criteria. In one example the visual features of a face are quantified and the quantification of the features is represented in a vector. Aspects of the vector are then represented in the form of text strings. Social context surrounding the face is also represented in the form of text strings. The text strings&#x2014;both the visual-based strings and/or the social-based strings&#x2014;are associated with the face and are stored in an index. The association of these strings with the face then may make the face text-searchable on both its visual and social features. Searches on these visual and/or social features may be used to help to assist in identifying new images of faces or to propose tags for users to apply to photos.
