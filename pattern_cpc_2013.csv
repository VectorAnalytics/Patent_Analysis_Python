Described are variational Expectation Maximization EM embodiments for learning a mixture model using component-dependent data partitions where the E-step is sub-linear in sample size while the algorithm still maintains provable convergence guarantees. Component-dependent data partitions into blocks of data items are constructed according to a hierarchical data structure comprised of nodes where each node corresponds to one of the blocks and stores statistics computed from the data items in the corresponding block.

The E-step can therefore consider the blocks or chunks of data items via their representative statistics rather than considering individual data items.

The handwriting recognition system increases the accuracy of handwriting recognizers that perform segmentation of ink into atomic elements segments and then classify each ink segment separately.

Cycles are repeating sequences of addresses. Each state is mapped to a &#x201c;randomly&#x201d; selected region within the input pattern. Each feature extracted from this region determines one of many next states. All next states one for each feature type and all sampled regions are assigned to each state randomly upon APM initialization. The process progresses from state to state sampling regions of the pattern until the state-transition sequence repeats generates a cycle . Each feature pattern is represented by one cycle however different cycles can be derived from one pattern depending on the initial state. Some embodiments use a refractory period assuring a minimum cycle length making it likely that any given pattern yields only one cycle independent of the initial state.
