The disclosure provides a filtering engine for selecting sparse filter components used to detect a material of interest or specific target in a hyperspectral imaging scene and applying the sparse filter to a plurality of pixels in the scene. The filtering engine transforms a spectral reference representing the material of interest to principal components space using the eigenvectors of the scene. It then ranks sparse filter components based on each transformed component of the spectral reference. The filtering engine selects sparse filter components based on their ranks. The filtering engine performs the subset selection quickly because the computations are minimized; it processes only the spectral reference vector and covariance matrix of the scene to do the subset selection rather than process a plurality of pixels in the scene as is typically done. The spectral filter scores for the plurality of pixels are calculated efficiently using the sparse filter.

Once the object is identified the positional and rate information is updated and the updated information is used to further cue the video camera into a higher resolution setting for recording a video clip of the moving object while the video camera is dynamically steered.

Hand-based biometric analysis systems and techniques are described which provide robust hand-based identification and verification. An image of a hand is obtained which is then segmented into a palm region and separate finger regions. Acquisition of the image is performed without requiring particular orientation or placement restrictions. Segmentation is performed without the use of reference points on the images.

Additionally the analysis utilizes re-use of commonly-seen terms in Zernike calculations to achieve additional efficiencies over traditional Zernike moment calculation.
