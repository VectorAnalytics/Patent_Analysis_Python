A method system and computer program product for improving accuracy and computation efficiency in interpolation upsampling and color channel estimation. A Bayesian estimator used to estimate the value of a pixel in an image is constructed using measurements of high-order e.g. 3rd 4th 5th statics for nearby points in natural images. These measurements reveal highly systematic statistical regularities that were ignored from the prior algorithms due to their restrictive measurements and assumptions. As a result the accuracy in interpolation upsampling and color channel prediction is improved. Furthermore the process for constructing a Bayesian estimator is simpler and more direct by storing in a table the mean value of the pixel value to be estimated for each combination of values of nearby points in training samples. As a result of having a simpler and more direct approach than existing methods the computational efficiency is improved.

The present invention concerns a method for deriving from an arbitrary local image descriptor a descriptor that is invariant under arbitrary mirror symmetries. For a point of interest pi for which the descriptor is to be determined a direction ODi is determined.

Thereby the local patch is brought into a normalized intrinsic orientation. Thereafter the descriptor is extracted. Examples include a mirror symmetry invariant version of Lowe s SIFT.
