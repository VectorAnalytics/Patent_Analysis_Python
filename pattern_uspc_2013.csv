An optical flow estimation process based on a spatio-temporal model with varying coefficients multiplying a set of basis functions at each pixel. The benefit of over-parameterization becomes evident in the smoothness term which instead of directly penalizing for changes in the optic flow accumulates a cost of deviating from the assumed optic flow model. The optical flow field is represented by a general space-time model comprising a selected set of basis functions. The optical flow parameters are computed at each pixel in terms of coefficients of the basis functions. The model is thus highly over-parameterized and regularization is applied at the level of the coefficients rather than the model itself. As a result the actual optical flow in the group of images is represented more accurately than in methods that are known in the art.

A robust OCR system requiring little computing capacity is obtained by first carrying out an adaptive pre-processing optimised in terms of pixel groups which analyses the image in line segments. The most significant difference compared to previously known methods is that there is no longer a direct pattern comparison instead the line segments are gone over in as optimum a manner as possible.

As this sequence of movements can be scaled well and described in a relatively simple manner this technique is especially suitable for mobile use. The sequence of movements of know characters is stored in a search word such that the letters can be directly deduced from the movement. A dictionary/lexicon can also be used. If words are recognized by means of the dictionary/lexicon the recognized letters can be used for an even more optimized character font identification. The invention is advantageous in that a robust OCR system is provided which also requires little computing capacity. The system according to the invention is robust especially in that the recognition works better than with conventional systems even under bad conditions especially light ratios and interferences.

In detecting semantic attributes of human body in computer vision the invention maintains a list of semantic attributes each of which corresponds to a human body part. A computer module then analyzes segments of a frame of a digital video to detect each semantic attribute by finding a most likely attribute for each segment.

A computer module computes a resolution context score for a lower resolution version of the image based on a weighted average score computed for a higher resolution version of the image by evaluating appearance features geometric features and resolution context features when available on the higher resolution version of the image. Finally an optimal configuration step is performed via dynamic programming to select an optimal output with both semantic attributes and spatial positions of human body parts on the frame.

A handwriting recognition system is described that includes a language model with scoring to improve recognition accuracy such as for words outside of a selected language model. The handwriting recognition system increases the accuracy of handwriting recognizers that perform segmentation of ink into atomic elements segments and then classify each ink segment separately. After segmentation a shape classifier estimates the class letter probabilities for each segment of ink by producing a corresponding score. The system applies the language model scoring to the shape classification results and typically selects the class with the highest score as the recognition result. Because the language model is not too restrictive it works well for recognizing any word even those that would not be in a dictionary for the current language. Thus the handwriting recognition system produces better recognition results and can often recognize words that dictionary-based language models would not recognize correctly.
