Mounting of gas turbine engines in aircraft requires use of thrust struts associated with mountings. It is important should there be failure that a load path is maintained. Furthermore on a wing or in-situ inspection is highly desirable with respect to reducing maintenance costs.

A method of using one or more microjets to create and/or control oblique shock waves. The introduction of microjet flow into a supersonic stream creates an oblique shock wave. This wave can be strengthened&#x2014;by increasing microjet flow rate or the use of many microjets in an array&#x2014;in order to form an oblique shock. Such an oblique shock can be used to decelerate flow in a jet aircraft engine inlet in a controlled fashion thus increasing pressure recovery and engine efficiency while reducing flow instability. Adjusting the pressure ratio across the microjet actually alters the angle of the oblique shock. Thus the use of microjets allows decelerating shock waves in an inlet engine to be properly positioned and controlled. Microjet arrays can also be used to ameliorate shock waves created by external aircraft surfaces such as sensor pods and weapons. Microjets placed forward of any external protuberance can convert a single substantial shock wave into a series of much milder waves which will not produce unwanted external effects such as strong sonic booms.
