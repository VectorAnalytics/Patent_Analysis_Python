The mounting mechanism includes a thrust load device including two side thrust links each including an aft end mounted on an evener bar of the device via a mechanical connection. Each connection is formed by a lug provided on the evener bar and passing through an orifice made in the aft end the lug being arranged so as to extend substantially laterally relative to the mounting structure.
A thrust mount arrangement is disclosed for mounting a gas turbine engine to an aircraft via a pylon. The thrust mount arrangement comprises a mounting bracket fixedly mountable to said pylon and a pair of thrust links connected to said mounting bracket and connectable to said engine so as to define in combination with said mounting bracket a primary load path between the engine and the pylon to carry engine loads under normal operating conditions. The arrangement is characterized in that said thrust links are each configured to engage the pylon directly in the event of failure of the primary load path so as to define an auxiliary load path between the engine and the pylon. This arrangement thus provides an auxiliary load path which follows a different route to the primary load path by eliminating the mounting bracket from the auxiliary load path. This provides a more robust arrangement in the event that the mounting bracket itself should fail.
A damage-tolerance attachment system for an aircraft engine includes first and second attachment devices attaching the aircraft engine to a pylon fixedly attached to the aircraft and a third backup attachment device including a first portion attached to the pylon and a second portion attached to the engine the first and second portions connected together loosely so as not to disrupt an isostasy of the first and second attachment devices.
A mounting system for a gas turbine engine includes a mounting linkage assembly and a tangential link positioned generally transverse to the mounting linkage assembly. The mounting linkage assembly reacts at least a thrust load. The tangential link reacts at least a vertical load a side load and a torque load of the gas turbine engine.
The invention relates to a jet engine nacelle intended to equip an aircraft comprising a forward air inlet section a mid-section intended to surround a fan of the jet engine and an aft section formed from at least first and second half-shells 9 10 rotatably mounted about an axis A such that they can each be deployed between a working position in which the half-shells 9 10 are drawn towards one another and a maintenance position in which the half-shells 9 10 are spaced apart the mid- and aft sections being connected to one another by a frame 12 which is fixed with respect to the jet engine the first and second half-shells 9 10 being equipped with positioning means 13 which in the working position cooperate with complementary positioning means 14 formed on the fixed frame 12 . At least the first half-shell 10 is equipped with the locking means 20 which in the maintenance position cooperate with complementary locking means 16 17 arranged on the fixed frame 12 so as to prevent the first half-shell 10 from moving translationally along its axis A .
A nacelle includes a central structure intended to surround a fan of a turbojet engine and an air intake structure attached to the central structure and able to channel a flow of air toward the fan. The nacelle includes at least one longitudinal outer panel incorporating an air intake lip. An inner panel includes an acoustic shell ring which downstream end is attached to an upstream end of the central structure and therewith forms a fixed structure of the nacelle. Guide means are entirely attached to the central structure for guiding the outer panel or panels and allowing substantially rectilinear movement of the outer panel towards the upstream end of the nacelle so that the air intake structure can be opened.
An engine attachment for an assembly system configured to be mounted between a rigid structure of an attachment strut of an aircraft engine and an engine. The attachment includes a main body a rudder bar on an articulated mounting on the main body by a hinge pin and two thrust absorption rods each with one end connected to the rudder bar. The main body includes a first main brace and a second main brace superimposed on the first brace. The hinge pin is formed by a first portion and a second portion wherein the first portion is made in one piece with the first brace and the second portion is made in one piece with the second brace. Furthermore the braces define a stop limit surface configured to limit rotation of the rudder bar.
According to the invention the engine pylon for the suspension of a turbo engine under an aircraft wing is such that the trailing edge of the rear lower part of the engine pylon is shifted toward the root of the wing.
An aircraft comprising an internal combustion engine by whose drive power a propeller can be driven wherein the internal combustion engine cooperates with an electric machine which in a first operating mode is operable as electric motor and in a second operating mode as electric generator.
