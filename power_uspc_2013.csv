Plates of one shaft are coupled to the shaft with individual energy members that return the plates to a disengaged position. The plates of the other shaft can be coupled together with a travel member and/or lug key and energy devices between at least some of the plates.
An aircraft has at least two jet-propulsion engines mounted laterally on the fuselage in a symmetrical design in the aft part of the fuselage. Each jet engine is mounted on the fuselage some distance from the vertical plane of symmetry of the aircraft so that the jet engine in a so-called half-buried configuration is partly inside an envelope surface of a theoretical fuselage. The half-buried jet engines are mounted on a main boom fitted on the vertical plane of symmetry of the aircraft inside the fuselage in back of a forward main frame. The tail sections are mounted on the main boom and the boom is integral with structures for transmitting forces into the forward part of the fuselage. The structure is advantageously made of fiber-reinforced composite materials.
